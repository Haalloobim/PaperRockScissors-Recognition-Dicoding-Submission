# Rock Paper Scissors Image Recognition
## By: Haalloobim

This repository contains the implementation of a Rock Paper Scissors image recognition project, submitted as part of a Dicoding course.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of classifying images of hand gestures into three categories: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Using a custom dataset of hand gesture images, the model is trained to recognize and differentiate between these gestures with high accuracy. This project showcases the use of deep learning techniques to solve a classic computer vision problem.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project consists of images depicting the hand gestures for Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The images are organized into three folders: 
- `rock`: Contains images of the Rock hand gesture.
- `paper`: Contains images of the Paper hand gesture.
- `scissors`: Contains images of the Scissors hand gesture.
